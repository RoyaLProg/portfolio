change username and password (and database if you didnt use portfolio) on api/src/app.module.ts

**dev server**

run `ng serve` in app folder and `nest start` in api folder

you can access the angular application on localhost:4200
and the nest api on localhost:3000

**production server**

#*API*

install pm2 :
```shell
apt install pm2
```

build your nest API and copy the JWT keys :
```shell
#cd api
nest build
cp -R dist/keys src/keys

```
(your api will be found on the dist folder, you can move it anywhere you like)

to run it :
```shell
pm2 start dist/main.js
```

#*APP*

change the "baseURL" to wherever uri your api will be in src/environment/environment.prod.ts

```shell
ng build
```

move the content of dist folder where ever you want (you can keep it where it is)

	#include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
	#
	# Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
	#
	# Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
	# Don't use them in a production server!
	#
	# include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

	root /path/to/folder; #change the path

	# Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	server_name your_server_name_here; #change to servername, example : domaine.fr
